# python-projects
**The Python projects are here.**  
`python-projects` is a bundle that has ALL my Python projects in one repo.  
Whether you're looking to have some fun with this, or even customize them your **own** way, this is **it.**  
Open-source with a MIT license.
## Projects
- `ascii.py` â€” A program that can find the ASCII character of any ASCII number, or find the ASCII code that the character responds to.
- `mathstuff.py` â€” A program that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide 2 numbers. It can also raise a number to a power, calculate the square root of a number, and round a number to the nearest `int`.
- `name.py` â€” A program that asks for your name, and greets you. It's the simplest program of all time.
- `round.py` â€” A program that can round a number up, down, or to the closest `int`. Literally just part of `mathstuff.py`.
- `sqrt.py` â€” A program that can find the square root of a number. Part of `mathstuff.py`, but comes with the advantage of calculating Ï€.
- `symlink.py` â€” A program that opens up a UI launcher to make a `.symlink`. Pretty cool! Right?
- `trollers=trash.py` A program that talks about a few Roblox trollers being trash. The **actual** most simple program ever.
- `terminal.py`â€” A program that is a custom terminal. Forshadowed over by [eg-power-kit](https://github.com/GreenCraft18/eg-power-kit), a `pwsh` module.
